# BUSCOMP: BUSCO Compiler and Comparison tool

BUSCOMP is designed to overcome some of the non-deterministic limitations of BUSCO to:

1. compile a non-redundant maximal set of non-redundant complete BUSCOs from a set of assemblies, and
2. use this set to provide a "true" comparison of completeness between different assemblies of the same genome
with predictable behaviour.

Full documentation is available in the [BUSCOMP.md](./BUSCOMP.md) file included in this repository. For a better rendering and navigation of this document, please download and open [`./docs/buscomp.docs.html`](./docs/buscomp.docs.html). This documentation can also be generated by running BUSCOMP with the `dochtml=T` option. (R and pandoc must be installed - see docs.) 

A quick start guide with example data will be added [here](./QUICKSTART.md).

## Citing BUSCOMP

BUSCOMP is not yet published, but the paper is in preparation. If you want to use BUSCOMP in a publication in the meantime, please get in touch and I will make sure that there is a DOI to cite!
